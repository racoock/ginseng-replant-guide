# Early Detection Methods

## Visual Symptoms

### Root Symptoms
- Stunted root development
- Discoloration (browning or blackening) of root tissues
- Reduced root hair formation
- Lesions or cankers on the taproot

### Foliage Symptoms
- Chlorosis (yellowing) of leaves, often starting at the margins
- Leaf curling or wilting, especially during periods of moisture stress
- Reduced leaf size and overall plant vigor
- Premature leaf drop in severe cases

## Importance of Soil Sampling
Soil sampling prior to planting is critical for assessing the risk of replant disease. Laboratory analysis can quantify populations of pathogenic fungi, nematodes, and other soil-borne organisms that contribute to soil sickness. A comprehensive soil test should include:
- Pathogen screening for *Fusarium*, *Pythium*, *Rhizoctonia*, and *Phytophthora* species
- Nematode assay
- Soil nutrient and pH analysis (to rule out nutritional causes of poor growth)

Growers should collect soil samples from multiple locations within the planned planting area, at the depth where roots will be most active (typically 15–30 cm). Samples should be taken in the season before planting to allow time for any recommended pre‑plant treatments.
